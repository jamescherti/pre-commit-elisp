# pre-commit-elisp - Emacs Lisp (Elisp) Git pre-commit hooks

The [pre-commit-elisp](https://github.com/jamescherti/pre-commit-elisp) repository offers pre-commit hooks for **Emacs Lisp (Elisp)** projects. These hooks enforce code quality and consistency by performing automated checks on `.el` files prior to committing changes:

* **`elisp-check-parens`**: Validates that all parentheses in `.el` files are correctly balanced.
* **`elisp-check-byte-compile`**: Byte-compile Elisp files to detect compilation errors.
* **`elisp-indent`**: Indent Elisp files according to Emacs Lisp style conventions.

These pre-commit hooks enforce syntactic correctness, successful byte-compilation, and consistent code formatting, ensuring a high standard of code quality and maintainability throughout the repository.

## Installation

1. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

2. Add this repository as a local hook in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
---

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/jamescherti/pre-commit-elisp
    rev: v1.0.3
    hooks:
      # Validate that all parentheses in .el files are correctly balanced
      - id: elisp-check-parens

      # Optional: Byte-compile .el files to identify compilation errors early
      # - id: elisp-check-byte-compile

      # Optional: Indent Elisp files according to Emacs Lisp style conventions
      # - id: elisp-indent
```

3. Install the hooks in your project:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

4. Run hooks manually on all files (optional):

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The tool uses a .pathaction.yaml rule-set file to determine which command to execute. Additionally, Jinja2 templating can be employed in the rule-set file to further customize the commands.
